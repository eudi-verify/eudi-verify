# Contributing to eudi-verify

Thank you for your interest in contributing to eudi-verify!

**Agent / AI tooling:** see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for read-first docs, verify-first expectations, and how `.cursor/rules/` relates to this guide.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/eudi-verify/eudi-verify.git
cd eudi-verify

# Install dependencies (requires Node.js 22+)
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Type check
pnpm typecheck

# Lint OpenAPI spec
pnpm lint:api

# Format (fix) / format check (CI)
pnpm format
pnpm format:check

# Run all CI checks locally (mirrors GitHub Actions)
pnpm verify

# Pre-release: Playwright e2e (embed + Vue + React examples; see docs/RELEASING.md)
pnpm exec playwright install   # once per machine
pnpm test:e2e

# Optional: install git hooks (format at commit, full CI at push)
pnpm hooks:install
```

The pre-commit hook auto-formats staged files with Prettier. If a hook fails, fix the reported issue and retry (or run `pnpm format` for the whole tree).

### Syncing with `main`

After merging PRs or when a maintainer cuts a release:

```bash
git switch main
git pull origin main
```

If pull fails with **conflicting tag(s)** (e.g. `v0.1.1`), your local tag object differs from `origin` — often a signed annotated tag locally vs a lightweight tag on the remote. Both may point at the same commit. Replace your local copy with the remote tag, then pull:

```bash
git fetch origin tag v0.X.Y --force
git pull origin main
```

Do not recreate or move release tags unless you are [cutting a release](docs/RELEASING.md).

Optional: auto-set upstream on first push of a new branch:

```bash
git config --global push.autoSetupRemote true
```

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode (enforced by `tsc --noEmit`)
- Use existing patterns from the codebase
- Add tests for new features
- Follow the existing commit message style (see below)

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <brief description>

<optional longer description>

<optional metadata>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`

Example:

```
feat(server): add rate limiting per session endpoint

- Add per-IP rate limiter for POST /sessions
- Add configurable threshold (default 10/min)
- Add 429 response with Retry-After header
```

## AI tooling (optional)

Cursor and other AI assistants are optional. You do not need them to contribute.

This repository includes [`.cursor/rules/`](.cursor/rules/) — Cursor-side copies of project conventions for agents using that editor. **The conventions themselves are required** (commit message format, documentation sync, public-docs accuracy, etc.); they are documented in this file and `docs/`. You can ignore the `.cursor/rules` files if you do not use Cursor.

- **Required (automated):** `pnpm verify` passes — mirrors CI (build, types, format, tests, OpenAPI lint, licenses, audit, source-security scan).
- **Required (review):** Commit message format and documentation guidelines in this file; human review for security-sensitive changes.
- **Optional:** Using Cursor, an AI assistant, or reading `.cursor/rules/` directly.
- **Public docs:** Do not add unevaluated third-party agent plugins or rulesets to `README.md`, `docs/`, or package READMEs.

## AI-assisted Development

This project uses AI-assisted tooling under human review. Contributors remain responsible for correctness, security, and integration of all changes, whether AI-assisted or not.

### When to Add Commit Metadata

| Situation                                                          | Action                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Substantive code/logic generated or heavily shaped by AI           | Add metadata footer (required)             |
| Docs/tests/scaffolding with minor AI help (spellcheck, formatting) | Optional footer; this policy is sufficient |
| Purely human-authored change                                       | No footer                                  |

### Commit Metadata Format

For AI-assisted work, add metadata after the commit body, separated by a blank line. The model name and version are required; the prompt summary is optional but recommended:

```
feat(embed): add keyboard trap for modal focus

- Trap focus inside verification dialog
- Restore focus on close

AI-assisted: <model-name> <version>
Prompt: <brief summary of what you asked> (optional)
```

If you edited AI-generated code manually, add `(edited)`:

```
fix(client): handle session timeout edge case

- Add retry logic for expired sessions
- Update state machine transitions

AI-assisted: <model-name> <version> (edited)
Prompt: Generate session timeout handling; manually verified state transitions (optional)
```

### Human Review Expectations

- Security-sensitive areas (`server` tokens, crypto, auth flows) require explicit human review before merge
- Contributors must understand and be able to explain design decisions in their PRs

See [.cursor/rules/commit-style.mdc](.cursor/rules/commit-style.mdc) for full conventional commit conventions.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git switch -c feat/my-feature`)
3. Make your changes with tests
4. Run `pnpm verify` to ensure everything passes (or `pnpm test` + `pnpm typecheck` + `pnpm format:check` for a quicker check). If format check fails, run `pnpm format`.
5. Commit your changes following the commit message format above
6. Push to your fork (`git push -u origin feat/my-feature` on first push) and submit a pull request

You do **not** need to add a changeset — maintainers add one at merge when your PR changes a published package ([Changesets](#changesets)).

## Testing

- Unit tests: `pnpm test`
- E2E (Playwright): one-time browser install from repo root — `npx playwright install chromium`
- E2E (embed widget / a11y): `cd packages/embed && pnpm test:e2e` — starts its own mock API and dev server
- E2E (Vue example dev smoke): `cd examples/vue && pnpm test:e2e` — catches Vite dev-only breakage that `pnpm build` misses; run when changing `examples/vue/` or example Vite configs
- E2E (React example dev smoke): `cd examples/react && pnpm test:e2e` — same for `examples/react/`; run when changing the React wrapper or its Vite config
- Test coverage is tracked but not enforced

**Maintainers:** after `pnpm verify`, run the e2e suite that matches the PR scope before merge — embed changes → embed e2e; `examples/vue/` → Vue e2e. React example e2e is not wired yet (follow-up).

## Documentation

If your change affects public APIs or user-facing behavior:

1. Update package READMEs in `packages/*/README.md`
2. Update `docs/INTEGRATION.md` and related `docs/integration-*.md` if integration steps change
3. Update `docs/SUPPORTED.md` if platform support changes
4. Keep `openapi/eudi-verifier.yaml` in sync with API changes

See [.cursor/rules/docs-sync.mdc](.cursor/rules/docs-sync.mdc) for detailed documentation sync guidelines.

## Architecture Decisions

Before proposing major changes, please review:

- [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) — Technical roadmap and design principles
- [.cursor/rules/project-context.mdc](.cursor/rules/project-context.mdc) — Framework-agnostic philosophy
- [DEPENDENCY.md](DEPENDENCY.md) — Dependency policy and sovereignty constraints

The project maintains strict framework-agnostic design: no React/Vue/Lit in core packages (`server`, `client`, `embed`). Framework bindings go in separate packages (e.g., `@eudi-verify/react` in WP9).

## Changesets

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management. **Maintainers** add a changeset when merging PRs that change published packages; contributors do not need to.

Contributors may still include a changeset if you want to propose changelog wording — maintainers can edit or replace it at merge.

### Two commands (do not confuse them)

| Command                  | When                                                               | Who                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm changeset`         | On the **PR branch**, before merge (when the PR changes a package) | Maintainers (optional for contributors)                  |
| `pnpm changeset version` | On **`main`**, when ready to ship to npm                           | Maintainers — see [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) |

`pnpm changeset` creates a small `.changeset/*.md` file (changelog line + semver bump type). It does **not** change `package.json` versions.

`pnpm changeset version` consumes all merged changeset files, bumps versions, updates changelogs, and deletes those files. That becomes the `chore: release` commit — not part of normal PRs.

### When a changeset is needed

| PR touches                                                               | Changeset? | Who adds it |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| `packages/server`, `client`, or `embed` (behavior, API, exports)         | **Yes**    | Maintainer  |
| Docs, examples, CI, OpenAPI-only with no package change                  | **No**     | —           |
| `@eudi-verify/demo-html-vanilla` or other unpublished workspace packages | **No**     | —           |

Do not add a changeset to “catch up” for older merged commits. Changesets are forward-looking: each merged PR documents what **that PR** contributes to the **next** release.

Maintainers add the changeset on the PR branch before merge — see [docs/RELEASING.md § Before merging package PRs](docs/RELEASING.md#before-merging-package-prs). After merge, the file sits on `main` until a maintainer runs the [release steps](docs/RELEASING.md).

### What to select in `pnpm changeset`

Published packages are **lockstep-versioned** (`.changeset/config.json` `fixed` group): bumping one of `server`, `client`, or `embed` bumps all three at release time.

1. **Packages** — select only the published package(s) the PR actually changed (usually one, e.g. `@eudi-verify/client`). Skip `@eudi-verify/demo-html-vanilla` and unchanged packages.
2. **Major bump?** — leave empty unless the change is breaking (Enter).
3. **Minor bump?** — leave empty unless the change is a new feature (Enter). What remains is a **patch** (typical for bugfixes).
4. **Summary** — one line for the changelog (e.g. “Fix QR code generation for wallet URLs.”).

### What contributors do not do

- Do not run `pnpm changeset version` on a feature branch or in a PR
- Do not bump `package.json` versions manually in PRs
- Do not edit changelogs for the next release in PRs (Changesets generates them at release time)

Maintainers: see [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for pre-merge changesets, `chore: release`, npm publish, signed tags, and GitHub releases.
